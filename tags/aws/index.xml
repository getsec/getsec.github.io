      <description>Preface The following list is my opinion on some of the top cloud controls that should be enabled within your environment. These can be security controls, processes, procedures or systems you create to manage and monitor your resources and users.
The List  Thou shalt use encryption everywhere. If its a checkbox, it gets turned on. Thou shalt not create public facing infrastructure without authorization or approval Thou shalt not blindly grant administration privileges to any principal Thou shalt follow the principle of least privilege when you are deploying policies or permissions Thou shalt not modify firewall rules to allow for all traffic.</description>

      <description>How can I query multiple AWS accounts for a lot of information. Well theres a few ways we can do this. Honestly what I believe is that leveraging a cross account role in each account is one the best ways to approach this. This allows for us to have the one spot for control and access. If you have a way to deploy this role in an automated way, that would be best.</description>
